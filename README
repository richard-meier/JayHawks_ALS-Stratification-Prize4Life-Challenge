Make sure to point the paths specified at the top of each script to the respective 
input and output files on your local hard disk drive. There are three subdirectories, 
which cover different aspects of the challenge. 


## The dataCleaning directory ##

These two scripts read in and clean the training data for both datasets. They also 
transform the data into the appropriate format that is required for downstream 
processing. If you are interested in running any of the other programs within this 
project you have to RUN THESE SCRIPTS FIRST, as they generate required input files.


## The clusteringAndModelSelection directory ##

Scripts contained in this directory illustrate how our team derived the final clusters 
and cluster models utilizing CART and stepwise feature selection. The ClusterCreation 
files were used to obtain classification rules for subsetting patients into clusters. 
The ModelCreation scripts were used to find prediction models for the specific 
outcomes within the derived cluster groups. In order for the ModelCreation scripts to 
run the CrossValidationUtilities scripts are loaded. These scripts contain functions 
for the stepwise feature selection procedure.


## The finalSubmission directory ##

This directory contains all scripts used for the final submission to the challenge. 
Each subdirectory corresponds to one of the four subchallenges. Selector scripts 
classify new patients, while Predictor scripts predict outcomes after 
classification. 
Before these two scripts can be executed the train_models scripts have to be executed. 
They generate the final prediction models based on the training set and save said 
models in a RData file that has to be loaded within the Predictor script.
